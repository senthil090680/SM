WORK and all accompanying printed materials, retaining no
copies.  The transferee's use of the WORK constitutes
acceptance of the terms of this License.

abuse, or misapplication. Any replacement disc will be

FOR DIRECT DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE WORK
SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR IT.  MERRIAM
SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR

ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR ANY OTHER
CLAIM. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON THE LENGTH
OF AN IMPLIED WARRANTY OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
